This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Dockerfiles: using the '&&' operator within the CMD instruction to chain multiple commands. While seemingly straightforward, this approach lacks robustness when the preceding command fails.  The provided Dockerfile and solution showcase the issue and its remedy, focusing on using ENTRYPOINT and CMD in a more reliable way. This pattern is crucial to ensure Docker containers behave predictably, especially within CI/CD pipelines.
